0
00:00:05,469 --> 00:00:11,769
So here we come to great explorers, to great investigators

1
00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:13,816
the Hodgkin and Huxley.

2
00:00:14,013 --> 00:00:19,076
So now, I'm going to explain to you, slowly,

3
00:00:19,249 --> 00:00:23,174
the mathematical model of Hodgkin and Huxley,

4
00:00:23,619 --> 00:00:29,269
you see both of them here, that really got there for their

5
00:00:29,502 --> 00:00:32,702
success in understanding the spike

6
00:00:32,912 --> 00:00:34,674
what they used to call the "action potential"

7
00:00:34,855 --> 00:00:36,730
we even use this term today

8
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,755
so for understanding the mathematics of the spike

9
00:00:39,947 --> 00:00:42,947
what is the underlying mechanism first

10
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:45,186
and how do I describe this mechanism

11
00:00:45,367 --> 00:00:47,291
in order to understand mathematically

12
00:00:47,487 --> 00:00:50,487
mathematically describe the spike.

13
00:00:50,739 --> 00:00:54,689
What Hodgkin and Huxley did, and for that they got a Nobel prize

14
00:00:54,905 --> 00:00:57,517
in 1962, is the following.

15
00:00:57,712 --> 00:01:01,487
First of all they found very, very convenient preparation

16
00:01:01,699 --> 00:01:05,212
the squid that you see in the middle.

17
00:01:06,559 --> 00:01:10,809
This is a very useful preparation because this particular animal

18
00:01:11,015 --> 00:01:14,615
has a very unique axon.

19
00:01:15,894 --> 00:01:18,894
This is now an axon, here is an axon...

20
00:01:22,253 --> 00:01:25,253
here is an axon

21
00:01:26,809 --> 00:01:30,422
of the squid, it's called the squid giant axon

22
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:36,281
it is giant, it is from here to here, it's a very thick axon,

23
00:01:36,977 --> 00:01:42,664
in our brain, our axon are very thin something of the order of a 1μm

24
00:01:42,865 --> 00:01:46,490
a thousandth of a millimeter, in diameter very thin

25
00:01:46,698 --> 00:01:49,811
but in the squid you have thick big axons

26
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:53,050
the squid giant axon, that's what it's called.

27
00:01:53,372 --> 00:01:55,922
Giant to the level that it's a half of a millimeter

28
00:01:56,112 --> 00:01:59,499
and this enabled Hodgkin and Huxley actually for the first time

29
00:01:59,704 --> 00:02:03,779
to directly record the electrical activity from the inside

30
00:02:03,971 --> 00:02:08,221
of this axon, because they succeeded to penetrate with a wire

31
00:02:08,432 --> 00:02:12,332
into the axon and really record the electrical activity

32
00:02:12,588 --> 00:02:16,000
or the voltage difference between the inside and the outside

33
00:02:16,212 --> 00:02:20,675
directly in this giant axon of the squid.

34
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:25,942
As I said, what Hodgkin and Huxley did

35
00:02:26,143 --> 00:02:32,643
they succeeded to take the squid axon here and put

36
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:39,383
a wire inside an axon here, so this is this wire I spoke about there,

37
00:02:39,641 --> 00:02:43,254
this is an electrode recording the voltage from within

38
00:02:43,526 --> 00:02:45,601
comparing it to the voltage outside.

39
00:02:45,804 --> 00:02:48,292
So they really measured the voltage drop

40
00:02:48,521 --> 00:02:51,521
the voltage difference between the inside and outside.

41
00:02:51,765 --> 00:02:54,790
Before I defined the membrane voltage

42
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:55,859
as the difference between

43
00:02:56,047 --> 00:02:58,572
the inside and outside across the membrane

44
00:02:58,784 --> 00:03:02,535
I said that at rest the voltage is -70mV

45
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,340
or something like that, inside versus outside.

46
00:03:05,522 --> 00:03:10,922
But what happens in the squid giant axon?

47
00:03:11,403 --> 00:03:15,353
They used a stimulation, they stimulated the axon

48
00:03:15,537 --> 00:03:18,399
because without stimulation it would sit at rest

49
00:03:18,642 --> 00:03:21,755
something like -70mV at rest,

50
00:03:24,632 --> 00:03:28,145
W=without any perturbation, but now they stimulate here

51
00:03:29,114 --> 00:03:32,952
the axon by making the inside more positive

52
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:34,026
than it was before.

53
00:03:34,218 --> 00:03:39,143
So instead of -70mV, the move the voltage to -50mV

54
00:03:39,313 --> 00:03:45,338
or -40mV, so the injected current inside of the cell.

55
00:03:46,138 --> 00:03:48,738
And here's what they found.

56
00:03:48,938 --> 00:03:51,250
When you do this you depolarize

57
00:03:51,434 --> 00:03:55,072
we call it depolarize, you make the inside more positive

58
00:03:55,273 --> 00:03:58,760
than the rest, so instead of being -70mV

59
00:03:58,993 --> 00:04:02,755
you depolarize the cell to a given level

60
00:04:03,133 --> 00:04:05,595
and suddenly you get this "boom",

61
00:04:05,771 --> 00:04:08,771
this white signal, the spike

62
00:04:08,969 --> 00:04:11,006
it behaves on its own.

63
00:04:11,226 --> 00:04:13,538
We just brought the membrane to this region

64
00:04:13,729 --> 00:04:16,991
to a given threshold, voltage threshold

65
00:04:17,214 --> 00:04:19,864
and suddenly there's a huge phenomenon

66
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,179
something as I mentioned of the order of 100mV

67
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:27,640
so it's an all-or-none phenomenon.

68
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,310
It happens or does not happen,

69
00:04:30,549 --> 00:04:33,799
and when it happens it has this very prototypical shape.

70
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:39,560
A 100mV or so in amplitude about 1ms in duration

71
00:04:39,783 --> 00:04:42,783
and then it's gone.

72
00:04:43,935 --> 00:04:50,422
This was the first inter-cellular direct recording by Hodgkin and Huxley

73
00:04:50,643 --> 00:04:53,643
actually in 1939.

74
00:04:54,588 --> 00:04:57,063
They saw the signal.

75
00:04:57,288 --> 00:04:59,675
But of course seeing the signal on its own

76
00:05:00,011 --> 00:05:04,211
does not mean that you understand the origin, the mechanism

77
00:05:04,454 --> 00:05:06,191
the underlying the signal.

78
00:05:06,408 --> 00:05:09,796
And that's where the genius of Hodgkin and Huxley came

79
00:05:09,987 --> 00:05:12,912
because they systematically analyzed in four papers

80
00:05:13,126 --> 00:05:17,413
actually more, but in 1952, there are four papers, A, B, C

81
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:23,621
and then the D paper, 1952 D, is the theoretical

82
00:05:23,806 --> 00:05:27,830
the mathematical paper explaining the signal in full.

83
00:05:28,042 --> 00:05:32,867
Very beautifully, very compactly, a very beautiful mathematical model

84
00:05:33,325 --> 00:05:36,075
for understanding the spike.

85
00:05:36,528 --> 00:05:39,353
So, first they showed experimentally that this is indeed

86
00:05:39,564 --> 00:05:42,439
and all-or-none, zero and one

87
00:05:42,628 --> 00:05:43,828
phenomenon.

88
00:05:44,021 --> 00:05:47,308
So look, if they stimulated, if they shift the voltage

89
00:05:47,525 --> 00:05:53,062
from -70mV, which is here, by let's say a few millivolts

90
00:05:53,249 --> 00:05:54,186
let's say, to here

91
00:05:54,378 --> 00:05:57,378
they got some voltage response, which decays.

92
00:06:00,034 --> 00:06:05,196
So this is another attempt, sub-threshold, it decays.

93
00:06:06,374 --> 00:06:09,774
But if you reach enough voltage if you depolarize

94
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:12,278
if you shift the membrane potential

95
00:06:12,454 --> 00:06:16,542
from -70mV enough, something of the order of 20mV

96
00:06:16,785 --> 00:06:20,698
more positive than -70mV, let's say between -70mV

97
00:06:20,928 --> 00:06:23,653
you shift the voltage by injecting the current

98
00:06:23,843 --> 00:06:26,806
into the cell, positive current inside the cell

99
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:30,121
then you suddenly see this phenomenon rising.

100
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,440
So this is an action potential.

101
00:06:32,641 --> 00:06:35,866
And if you inject it even stronger, inside the cell

102
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,238
you get another action potential.

103
00:06:38,429 --> 00:06:41,179
But all of this action potential have the same shape

104
00:06:41,397 --> 00:06:43,560
and when they appear, they appear in full.

105
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:47,179
there is no half-action potential, or a third-action potential.

106
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:49,756
It's an all or none phenomenon.

107
00:06:49,975 --> 00:06:53,525
So it's either sub-threshold, where you don't get a spike

108
00:06:53,719 --> 00:06:57,319
or it's super-threshold, when you get a full spike.

109
00:06:57,516 --> 00:07:01,554
And again, the threshold is more positive than the resting potential.

110
00:07:01,783 --> 00:07:05,270
So the spike starts from -70mV or -50mV

111
00:07:05,478 --> 00:07:08,228
and then it goes 100mV high and then

112
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:11,324
it disappears after 1ms, 2ms, or 3ms.

113
00:07:11,536 --> 00:07:16,436
So that's the all-or-none property of the spike.

114
00:07:16,633 --> 00:07:19,371
It's a very interesting signal

115
00:07:19,568 --> 00:07:23,693
as I said, it appears in axons and this was very lucky

116
00:07:23,882 --> 00:07:26,857
for Hodgkin and Huxley to have this squid giant axon

117
00:07:27,053 --> 00:07:29,853
where they could record from the inside and from the outside

118
00:07:30,044 --> 00:07:32,069
and can manipulate ion concentrations

119
00:07:32,256 --> 00:07:33,969
which I'll show you in a second

120
00:07:34,173 --> 00:07:37,173
but they could study the spike directly

121
00:07:37,388 --> 00:07:43,213
in this squid's giant axons and amazingly the same mechanism

122
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,513
of spike generation in axon of the squid giant axon

123
00:07:46,755 --> 00:07:50,705
is also true from most of the axons we know today.

124
00:07:50,891 --> 00:07:53,891
So this basic mechanism that Hodgkin and Huxley found

125
00:07:54,156 --> 00:07:56,844
is really universal for axons of many types

126
00:07:57,104 --> 00:08:00,667
including the axons of the different cell types in our brain

127
00:08:00,858 --> 00:08:07,021
that also generate what we call today a sodium spike.

128
00:08:07,209 --> 00:08:09,934
I will tell you in a second why it's a sodium spike.

129
00:08:10,138 --> 00:08:14,800
Okay, so we came to the point where we now want to go into

130
00:08:15,026 --> 00:08:16,326
the Hodgkin and Huxley model.

131
00:08:16,516 --> 00:08:18,954
So before I just show you the description of the spike

132
00:08:19,181 --> 00:08:22,181
how does it look like, it appears, it disappears

133
00:08:22,393 --> 00:08:26,568
it has a threshold, it is an all-or-none phenomenon.

134
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:31,384
But now how do you measure the underlying membrane mechanism

135
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:36,316
that enabled the spikes to be generated?

136
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:41,693
So that's the beautiful trick that Hodgkin and Huxley were using.

137
00:08:42,553 --> 00:08:46,877
They did actually use two tricks, one is called the Voltage clamp

138
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,188
here

139
00:08:48,646 --> 00:08:50,908
and the other one is called the space clamp.

140
00:08:51,122 --> 00:08:55,072
So their idea was to take this wire, a long wire

141
00:08:55,339 --> 00:08:58,339
into the axon and so the axon becomes

142
00:08:58,987 --> 00:09:03,812
iso-potential, because of this wire which is highly conductive

143
00:09:04,007 --> 00:09:05,882
there is no voltage drop between this location

144
00:09:06,066 --> 00:09:07,065
and this location

145
00:09:07,267 --> 00:09:12,142
so the whole elongated axon becomes electrically very compact

146
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:15,350
because of this axial wire

147
00:09:15,835 --> 00:09:19,335
but also they use a voltage clamp and that's the ingenious trick

148
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:22,530
that was not actually only devised by them

149
00:09:22,856 --> 00:09:26,744
but also by others, and the idea was to

150
00:09:26,971 --> 00:09:32,446
try to clamp, to determine the voltage between the two

151
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:33,718
sides of the membrane,

152
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,219
to force the two sides of the membrane

153
00:09:36,413 --> 00:09:39,538
to have a fixed voltage: a voltage clamp.

154
00:09:40,017 --> 00:09:41,604
Why did they want to do it?

155
00:09:41,801 --> 00:09:44,951
Because they want to measure what currents flow through

156
00:09:45,162 --> 00:09:48,950
the membrane when I clamp the membrane to a given voltage

157
00:09:49,161 --> 00:09:53,149
let's say, now I depolarize the membrane by 20mV

158
00:09:53,353 --> 00:09:56,590
from -70mV to -50mV, and fix it like this.

159
00:09:56,869 --> 00:09:59,119
And then measure which are the currents that flow

160
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:02,961
through the membrane when I depolarize the membrane by 20mV

161
00:10:03,223 --> 00:10:05,748
30mV, 40mV, and so forth.

162
00:10:05,952 --> 00:10:09,277
So I don't allow the spike to occur anymore

163
00:10:09,503 --> 00:10:11,702
because I've fixed via voltage clamp

164
00:10:11,881 --> 00:10:14,519
the membrane voltage between the two sides

165
00:10:14,722 --> 00:10:17,234
of the membrane, I don't allow it to change

166
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:20,197
and in order to do it, I need to develop a whole

167
00:10:20,414 --> 00:10:25,689
feedback system, so whenever the spike,

168
00:10:25,901 --> 00:10:29,688
wants to start to be initiated, I block it, I do no allow it

169
00:10:29,914 --> 00:10:33,439
because I want to fix the voltage by injecting a negative current

170
00:10:33,643 --> 00:10:38,518
into the membrane to really balance the voltage into my

171
00:10:38,723 --> 00:10:41,861
voltage clamp pre-determined value.

172
00:10:42,369 --> 00:10:44,607
So I control the spike, so to speak

173
00:10:44,823 --> 00:10:48,223
by fixing the voltage between the two sides of the membrane

174
00:10:48,549 --> 00:10:52,461
by injecting negative currents through my feedback system.

175
00:10:52,722 --> 00:10:57,347
And then I can really measure what current I should inject

176
00:10:57,545 --> 00:11:01,207
in order to fix the voltage between the two sides of the membrane

177
00:11:01,392 --> 00:11:02,579
to be fixed.

178
00:11:02,831 --> 00:11:05,031
And that's the voltage clamp idea.

179
00:11:05,224 --> 00:11:10,574
It enables to uncover the ion currents that flow behind

180
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:14,082
below the spike, so to speak.

181
00:11:15,004 --> 00:11:18,004
So I've explained to you what is the space clamp

182
00:11:18,218 --> 00:11:21,218
and I've explained to you what is the voltage clamp

183
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:25,962
and I've told you that this electric feedback system

184
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,082
enables to control the voltage very rapidly

185
00:11:30,277 --> 00:11:33,277
so the voltage between the two sides of the membrane will be fixed.

186
00:11:33,496 --> 00:11:36,308
What did they find using this technique?

187
00:11:36,604 --> 00:11:38,666
So here's what they found:

188
00:11:38,873 --> 00:11:41,585
They found that, when you voltage clamp the membrane

189
00:11:43,501 --> 00:11:47,501
above a certain level, so here they started at -60mV

190
00:11:47,743 --> 00:11:52,993
and they jump to 0mV so this is a 60mV depolarization

191
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:57,867
and using their feedback system record which are the underlying

192
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:03,566
currents during this voltage step, voltage clamp,

193
00:12:03,768 --> 00:12:05,517
they see something interesting.

194
00:12:05,712 --> 00:12:11,862
There is a very fast early inward current

195
00:12:12,072 --> 00:12:17,872
and a late outward current.

196
00:12:20,076 --> 00:12:22,951
So they fixed the voltage, they don't change it anymore

197
00:12:23,205 --> 00:12:25,254
so it's a fixed voltage clamp

198
00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:28,221
and they measure the current that needs to be injected

199
00:12:28,449 --> 00:12:31,449
in order to keep the voltage clamp fixed

200
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:36,330
and they see that in the membrane, while doing this voltage clamp

201
00:12:36,542 --> 00:12:41,979
there is first an inward current, and when I say inward I mean

202
00:12:42,206 --> 00:12:46,631
flowing form the outside into the inside of the cell,

203
00:12:46,874 --> 00:12:50,862
later they found out that this is carried by

204
00:12:51,087 --> 00:12:55,024
sodium channels and if you wait enough time

205
00:12:55,313 --> 00:12:58,226
the current, instead of flowing into the membrane

206
00:12:58,464 --> 00:13:02,914
into the cell, it flows outside and this is the outward current

207
00:13:03,111 --> 00:13:06,111
which is carried by potassium channels

208
00:13:06,492 --> 00:13:08,504
or potassium current.

209
00:13:08,732 --> 00:13:14,445
So this was a very interesting finding that during voltage clamp

210
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:18,805
and later of course I will show that it's also during the spike itself

211
00:13:19,014 --> 00:13:21,264
when you reach the threshold

212
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:24,218
very early on, after you reach the threshold

213
00:13:24,427 --> 00:13:28,602
there is an opening of sodium ion channels

214
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,600
that are open because you reach a voltage threshold

215
00:13:33,802 --> 00:13:37,115
so these ion channels are voltage dependent ion channels

216
00:13:37,302 --> 00:13:38,952
we'll talk about this in a second

217
00:13:39,144 --> 00:13:41,032
because you reach this voltage threshold

218
00:13:41,214 --> 00:13:44,614
very early on, there is an inward current

219
00:13:44,816 --> 00:13:49,766
of sodium flowing from the outside to the inside, making the inside

220
00:13:49,982 --> 00:13:53,582
even more positive during the spike

221
00:13:53,804 --> 00:13:56,804
and a little bit later on, a few milliseconds later on

222
00:13:56,996 --> 00:14:01,808
you see an outward current, meaning that the potassium channels

223
00:14:01,992 --> 00:14:07,129
are open carrying current from inside to outside.

224
00:14:08,364 --> 00:14:09,577
Ok?

225
00:14:09,819 --> 00:14:12,319
So there are these two separate currents

226
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:16,502
that underlay voltage change in the giant squid axon.

227
00:14:16,704 --> 00:14:20,542
The early current which starts and then then ends

228
00:14:20,731 --> 00:14:23,355
so it activates and inactivates

229
00:14:23,631 --> 00:14:26,631
it activates and then inactivates

230
00:14:26,943 --> 00:14:30,806
very fast and early, and then later on there is

231
00:14:31,018 --> 00:14:34,643
a current that is activated, the potassium current is activated

232
00:14:34,829 --> 00:14:38,592
and it lasts as long as there is a voltage clamp.

233
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:40,270
So we call the early current

234
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,475
we know now that the early current is

235
00:14:42,663 --> 00:14:47,538
sodium-transient activated and inactivated

236
00:14:47,738 --> 00:14:50,163
during the voltage clamp, and the later current

237
00:14:50,374 --> 00:14:53,374
that activates later and remains open

238
00:14:54,032 --> 00:14:57,032
remains flowing this potassium current

239
00:14:57,351 --> 00:15:02,089
remains flowing from inside to the outside of the membrane

240
00:15:02,452 --> 00:15:03,740
during the voltage clamp.

241
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:07,905
So these are the two basic currents that Hodgkin and Huxley found

242
00:15:08,153 --> 00:15:12,128
that underlie the generation of the spike

243
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:14,702
in the membrane of the squid giant axon.

244
00:15:14,917 --> 00:15:16,441
What did they do next?

245
00:15:16,633 --> 00:15:17,907
What did they do next?

246
00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:21,976
Next they did voltage clamp to different levels.

247
00:15:22,335 --> 00:15:27,660
Here is an example of voltage clamps to different levels.

248
00:15:28,119 --> 00:15:34,331
So from -60 to -40 from -60 to -20, and so forth

249
00:15:34,575 --> 00:15:37,175
so they clamped the membrane to different levels

250
00:15:37,368 --> 00:15:40,206
and they measured these two currents that I've mentioned before.

251
00:15:40,471 --> 00:15:42,358
The early sodium current

252
00:15:42,543 --> 00:15:46,930
now reversed just for the purpose of showing it

253
00:15:47,134 --> 00:15:50,572
but it should have been inward, it should've been in this direction

254
00:15:50,765 --> 00:15:52,564
in this direction

255
00:15:52,809 --> 00:15:58,784
so this is the early inward current that is carried by sodium

256
00:15:59,863 --> 00:16:03,326
and this is the late current, the potassium current

257
00:16:03,534 --> 00:16:07,797
that is late relative to the early one, during voltage clamp.

258
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:10,219
So this is what Hodgkin and Huxley did

259
00:16:10,409 --> 00:16:15,871
they tried to decipher, to analyze separately

260
00:16:16,064 --> 00:16:19,677
mathematically how to describe the early current

261
00:16:19,903 --> 00:16:21,865
and how to describe the late current

262
00:16:22,088 --> 00:16:25,088
the potassium current mathematically.

263
00:16:25,411 --> 00:16:27,124
Because they had all these measurements

264
00:16:27,309 --> 00:16:29,434
they could fit mathematical equations

265
00:16:29,612 --> 00:16:31,387
for each one of these currents.

266
00:16:31,586 --> 00:16:35,474
The important thing to know here, and you already can see it here

267
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:40,771
is that the currents themselves, both potassium and sodium

268
00:16:40,988 --> 00:16:43,463
are both voltage dependent, because you can see

269
00:16:43,662 --> 00:16:46,100
if I change the voltage

270
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:49,804
I get different currents, but it's also time dependent

271
00:16:50,036 --> 00:16:52,198
as we said before.

272
00:16:52,397 --> 00:16:54,822
The first one is this sodium, and it's very important

273
00:16:55,017 --> 00:16:58,729
that the first early current in voltage clamp is the sodium current

274
00:16:58,947 --> 00:17:03,060
going inward, and this also changes in time as you get more

275
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:04,396
depolarization.

276
00:17:04,593 --> 00:17:08,993
So it's for small depolarization, you get a slower inward current

277
00:17:09,231 --> 00:17:10,343
of sodium

278
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:15,879
for a larger depolarization, you'll get a faster sodium current

279
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:17,624
and also a bigger sodium current.

280
00:17:17,844 --> 00:17:24,082
So these are currents that are both voltage and time dependent.

281
00:17:24,259 --> 00:17:27,434
So in principle, I should be able and that's what Hodgkin and Huxley

282
00:17:27,608 --> 00:17:29,222
tried to do.

283
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,240
To describe the conductance of, let's say, the potassium

284
00:17:34,448 --> 00:17:38,936
as a function of time and of membrane voltage.

285
00:17:39,145 --> 00:17:42,645
Similar to the sodium channels.

286
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:46,210
So this is the sodium conductance but this conductance depends

287
00:17:46,421 --> 00:17:49,421
both on time and on voltage.

288
00:17:50,874 --> 00:17:54,049
So I should tell you now, without going into the details

289
00:17:54,252 --> 00:17:57,914
that we know today that in the axons there are these marvelous, unique

290
00:17:58,142 --> 00:18:04,167
absolutely unique ion channels that carry potassium and sodium

291
00:18:04,385 --> 00:18:06,498
as we discussed before, but in this case

292
00:18:06,698 --> 00:18:10,635
these ion channels that are in the axons

293
00:18:10,848 --> 00:18:12,985
are sensitive to voltage

294
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:16,079
They are voltage dependent.

295
00:18:16,307 --> 00:18:21,957
So what makes these channels open and close

296
00:18:22,187 --> 00:18:23,624
is voltage.

297
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,492
They are sensitive to voltage.

298
00:18:25,709 --> 00:18:28,709
These are voltage dependent ion channels.

299
00:18:28,924 --> 00:18:32,537
That's why I wrote that the conductance here

300
00:18:33,275 --> 00:18:36,275
of the sodium is voltage dependent.

301
00:18:36,804 --> 00:18:39,804
It also takes time for this conductance to open

302
00:18:39,843 --> 00:18:42,181
so it's also time dependent.

303
00:18:42,391 --> 00:18:44,291
So these are very unique channels

304
00:18:44,509 --> 00:18:47,771
they are mostly embedded in the membrane of the axon

305
00:18:48,006 --> 00:18:51,006
so the axon is absolutely decorated very densely

306
00:18:51,556 --> 00:18:54,406
with voltage dependance ion channels

307
00:18:54,854 --> 00:18:57,567
both for potassium and sodium

308
00:18:57,753 --> 00:19:02,016
and these channels are the channels

309
00:19:02,302 --> 00:19:05,302
that enable the generation of the spike

310
00:19:05,598 --> 00:19:07,785
as I will show you in a second.

311
00:19:08,589 --> 00:19:11,589
So, let's continue with the Hodgkin and Huxley discovery.

312
00:19:11,869 --> 00:19:14,319
So first of all, Hodgkin and Huxley

313
00:19:14,576 --> 00:19:17,876
drew this circuit.

314
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:21,429
Here's the Hodgkin and Huxley

315
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:25,445
circuit of the squid giant axon membrane

316
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:29,540
and as you can see here, there are these

317
00:19:29,756 --> 00:19:34,219
sodium channels that are voltage and time dependent,

318
00:19:34,546 --> 00:19:39,296
there are potassium conductances that are voltage and time dependent,

319
00:19:39,488 --> 00:19:42,151
and there is this thing that we call Leak conductance

320
00:19:42,338 --> 00:19:45,550
which is the conductance that is not voltage dependent

321
00:19:45,877 --> 00:19:48,302
these are what we sometimes call "the passive conductance"

322
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:52,487
these are all other ion channels, sodium, potassium, and chloride

323
00:19:52,707 --> 00:19:54,682
that do not depend on voltage.

324
00:19:54,887 --> 00:20:00,137
So these are the two channels, the potassium and the sodium

325
00:20:00,334 --> 00:20:02,246
that are voltage dependent that

326
00:20:02,477 --> 00:20:04,626
underlie the generation of the spike.

327
00:20:04,849 --> 00:20:08,537
And here you see the membrane capacitance

328
00:20:08,713 --> 00:20:10,701
which are, as I said, all the other things

329
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,443
that are not channels, which can accumulate ions

330
00:20:13,641 --> 00:20:15,979
inside and outside of the membrane.

331
00:20:16,251 --> 00:20:19,826
By the way, in this case they drew the case upside down

332
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,313
so this is the inside, so this is the negative part

333
00:20:23,546 --> 00:20:25,283
of the neuron and this is the outside

334
00:20:25,581 --> 00:20:28,105
which they connected to ground.

335
00:20:28,308 --> 00:20:30,308
And this is the total of the Hodgkin and Huxley

336
00:20:30,527 --> 00:20:32,814
equation here, so the current that flows

337
00:20:33,051 --> 00:20:34,139
through the membrane

338
00:20:34,337 --> 00:20:37,925
through this piece of model membrane here

339
00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:41,179
is a sum of the capacitative current

340
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,053
so we didn't go into it, but the capacitative current

341
00:20:44,253 --> 00:20:49,040
is always the capacitant C multiplied by derivative with time

342
00:20:49,216 --> 00:20:53,166
dV/dt of the voltage across the membrane

343
00:20:53,337 --> 00:20:55,812
so this is the voltage across the membrane V

344
00:20:56,084 --> 00:20:57,609
as we discussed before.

345
00:20:57,816 --> 00:20:59,866
So this is a voltage equation here

346
00:21:00,078 --> 00:21:04,366
and it's actually currents, so the total membrane current here

347
00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:06,839
is the sum of the capacitance current

348
00:21:07,181 --> 00:21:15,268
the capacitance plus the sodium current I_Na

349
00:21:15,654 --> 00:21:19,717
you already saw equation, but in this case

350
00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:26,329
you have this sodium conductance which is voltage and time dependent.

351
00:21:26,525 --> 00:21:31,612
It's an excitable channel, it's a voltage dependent channel

352
00:21:31,805 --> 00:21:36,655
similarly to the potassium current

353
00:21:36,894 --> 00:21:40,581
and also the leak one, but here it's a mistake, you see

354
00:21:40,781 --> 00:21:45,531
the leak voltage is independent, so this is I_Leak.

355
00:21:46,074 --> 00:21:49,074
So this is the total current that flows through the membrane

356
00:21:49,532 --> 00:21:51,094
during the spike.

357
00:21:51,315 --> 00:21:53,665
The question is, can we use the clamp

358
00:21:54,139 --> 00:21:57,527
and the measurements they did of the dependence

359
00:21:57,764 --> 00:22:02,651
of membrane currents on voltage, to now describe

360
00:22:02,847 --> 00:22:05,122
the generation of the spike, because remember

361
00:22:05,326 --> 00:22:08,026
the spike itself is a voltage change

362
00:22:08,255 --> 00:22:10,192
it's not a voltage clamp, because it changes

363
00:22:10,382 --> 00:22:13,382
from time to time, changes, changes, and then goes down

364
00:22:13,646 --> 00:22:17,833
but for each voltage, we know from the voltage clamp

365
00:22:18,068 --> 00:22:20,393
what are the supposingly currents

366
00:22:20,576 --> 00:22:23,251
both potassium and sodium, they go through the membrane

367
00:22:23,436 --> 00:22:25,724
in this voltage, and then in this voltage

368
00:22:25,936 --> 00:22:30,411
so the voltage clam was a tool to study the dependence

369
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:35,074
of this current on voltage and then use it

370
00:22:35,296 --> 00:22:40,208
to try to mathematically describe the transient behavior of the spike

371
00:22:40,471 --> 00:22:42,483
using what we learned from the voltage clamp.

372
00:22:42,691 --> 00:22:45,841
Of course, as they succeeded, otherwise they wouldn't get

373
00:22:46,024 --> 00:22:49,349
the Nobel prize, because they did a wonderful work in transforming

374
00:22:49,585 --> 00:22:51,060
from what they learned form the voltage clamp

375
00:22:51,258 --> 00:22:53,445
into describing the spike.

376
00:22:53,631 --> 00:22:55,144
So here it is.

377
00:22:55,342 --> 00:22:59,379
This is one example of a voltage clamp experiment

378
00:22:59,581 --> 00:23:03,831
and a mathematical attempt to capture the current that

379
00:23:04,022 --> 00:23:06,072
they measure, so the continuous line here

380
00:23:06,261 --> 00:23:08,385
this line

381
00:23:08,576 --> 00:23:11,576
is the theoretical line and these dots

382
00:23:11,902 --> 00:23:15,227
are the experimental dots measured by Hodgkin and Huxley

383
00:23:15,433 --> 00:23:17,107
for this particular step

384
00:23:17,298 --> 00:23:20,298
and then they used this equation

385
00:23:21,467 --> 00:23:24,217
to try to describe, in this case

386
00:23:24,459 --> 00:23:30,534
the conductance of the potassium.

387
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:33,505
So this is the conductance of the potassium.

388
00:23:33,735 --> 00:23:37,923
They say that they can fit very well this particular

389
00:23:39,654 --> 00:23:43,317
experimental result by describing

390
00:23:43,538 --> 00:23:46,500
the conductance, so this is again

391
00:23:46,707 --> 00:23:49,331
a function of T and V

392
00:23:49,534 --> 00:23:50,584
yes

393
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:53,780
by maximal conductance, so this is a total

394
00:23:54,054 --> 00:23:56,941
conductance of potassium in a piece of membrane

395
00:23:57,129 --> 00:23:59,929
if everything would've openned, you would get this

396
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,752
total conductance of the potassium

397
00:24:02,963 --> 00:24:05,925
multiplied by some parameter which they call "n"

398
00:24:06,131 --> 00:24:08,193
the activation variable.

399
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:13,120
And this "n" is a parameter. that in some sense

400
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:18,020
it tells you which proportions, what is the proportion

401
00:24:18,261 --> 00:24:21,261
of the ions available, potassium ions available

402
00:24:21,477 --> 00:24:23,202
in the membrane that are open.

403
00:24:23,415 --> 00:24:26,415
So "n" goes from 0 to 1.

404
00:24:27,243 --> 00:24:29,781
So if it's zero there is no conductance

405
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:32,570
for potassium, everything is closed

406
00:24:32,786 --> 00:24:34,410
and it's one, it's the maximal

407
00:24:34,592 --> 00:24:36,079
all the channels are open.

408
00:24:36,258 --> 00:24:38,258
So that's how Hodgkin and Huxley thought

409
00:24:38,452 --> 00:24:43,377
about the potassium channels, and they realized that this "n"

410
00:24:43,574 --> 00:24:45,661
this "n" parameter

411
00:24:45,898 --> 00:24:50,173
as I said, it also depends on voltage

412
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:51,907
and on time.

413
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:56,549
So this probability, or this parameter

414
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:59,113
between zero and one, that can be thought of as

415
00:24:59,309 --> 00:25:00,409
probability,

416
00:25:00,612 --> 00:25:06,037
this probability to be open, the channel probability to be open

417
00:25:06,239 --> 00:25:08,489
depends on voltage, so the more voltage

418
00:25:08,729 --> 00:25:10,465
depolarization you have

419
00:25:10,658 --> 00:25:13,233
the more probability that the channel will be open,

420
00:25:13,449 --> 00:25:17,287
but it will also take some time for this channel to open

421
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:21,395
and this time dependence is also voltage dependence.

422
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,903
Ok, so that's the channel.

423
00:25:24,113 --> 00:25:27,563
Here is the complete equation of Hodgkin and Huxley

424
00:25:27,756 --> 00:25:29,593
you just saw this one.

425
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:36,351
And now they describe this parameter "n" here

426
00:25:38,439 --> 00:25:41,551
by two extra additional parameters

427
00:25:41,746 --> 00:25:44,746
αn and βn

428
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:49,257
these are the rate constances by which the channel opens

429
00:25:49,545 --> 00:25:51,695
or closes.

430
00:25:51,907 --> 00:25:56,970
So this is the closed state of the channel

431
00:25:57,537 --> 00:26:03,262
and this is the rate by which the closed state of the channel

432
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:05,034
tends to open,

433
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:10,205
and βn is the rate by which the open state of the channel

434
00:26:10,396 --> 00:26:12,170
tends to close.

435
00:26:12,385 --> 00:26:19,385
So that's how they describe this activation function "n"

436
00:26:19,648 --> 00:26:23,273
for the potassium to depend on these rate functions

437
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,842
of the channel, like a chemical reaction

438
00:26:26,022 --> 00:26:28,822
either to go towards the closed state of the channel

439
00:26:29,036 --> 00:26:31,849
or to go towards the open state of the channel

440
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:34,802
and this is the description of this channel

441
00:26:35,008 --> 00:26:38,970
and beta and alpha are both voltage dependent.

442
00:26:39,436 --> 00:26:42,936
So this is voltage dependent, and this is voltage independent

443
00:26:43,136 --> 00:26:47,661
and eventually "n", of course, is both time and voltage dependent.

444
00:26:47,851 --> 00:26:52,688
So that's the Hodgkin and Huxley equation for the potassium channel.

445
00:26:53,284 --> 00:26:55,947
It has a conductance, the conductance depends

446
00:26:56,163 --> 00:27:01,163
on this activation variable "n", and this activation variable n""

447
00:27:01,393 --> 00:27:06,593
depends on the activation rate of making the closed channel open

448
00:27:06,846 --> 00:27:11,584
Alpha "n", and the activation rate, activation function

449
00:27:11,804 --> 00:27:18,029
in units of 1 over time, of making the open channel close.

450
00:27:18,842 --> 00:27:21,479
And as I said, the α and the β

451
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:23,706
are both only voltage dependent.

452
00:27:23,969 --> 00:27:26,969
"n" is both time and voltage dependent.

453
00:27:27,272 --> 00:27:33,634
And now they try to fit this whole equation,

454
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:37,239
this hole experimental behavior, so this is the continuous line here

455
00:27:37,428 --> 00:27:41,828
they are trying to do a good mathematical approximation

456
00:27:42,086 --> 00:27:45,673
and they found these two equations both for α

457
00:27:45,875 --> 00:27:50,588
as a function of V, and for β as a function of V.

458
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,725
These two particular equation without getting into the details

459
00:27:53,966 --> 00:27:56,478
of why they choose this particularity equation

460
00:27:56,721 --> 00:27:59,721
they had the intuition of how this equation should look like

461
00:28:00,015 --> 00:28:03,015
and they fit the numbers here and here, and so on

462
00:28:03,216 --> 00:28:07,116
and they get a wonderful fit as you see here

463
00:28:07,294 --> 00:28:12,606
between the experimental results and the theoretical curve.

464
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:15,810
So this is sketchuring... these equations

465
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:20,580
now capture the behavior of the potassium current

466
00:28:20,786 --> 00:28:22,810
or the potassium conductance.

467
00:28:22,988 --> 00:28:24,713
They did the same thing for the sodium

468
00:28:24,896 --> 00:28:28,583
the sodium is more complicated, here is a voltage clamp experiment

469
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:32,342
so they clamp it to this voltage, and to a bigger voltage

470
00:28:32,842 --> 00:28:34,305
and to a larger voltage, and so forth

471
00:28:34,511 --> 00:28:39,761
and they got this set of curves and now they are trying to

472
00:28:39,969 --> 00:28:42,969
do the exact same procedure, like they do for the potassium

473
00:28:44,059 --> 00:28:45,596
separately for sodium.

474
00:28:45,805 --> 00:28:49,167
This is more complicated, because as discussed before

475
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:53,230
the sodium first activates and then inactivates

476
00:28:53,555 --> 00:28:57,193
The sodium first activates and then, although you continue

477
00:28:57,384 --> 00:29:00,384
to hold the voltage clamp, it goes down.

478
00:29:00,941 --> 00:29:03,941
So there are two stages, separate stages

479
00:29:04,166 --> 00:29:06,028
to the sodium channel.

480
00:29:06,218 --> 00:29:09,493
It activates during the polarization but at the same time

481
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,645
it also starts to inactivate.

482
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:14,850
So that's what makes the equation more difficult.

483
00:29:15,381 --> 00:29:19,919
So there is this "m" variable, which behaves like the "n" variable

484
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,764
but the activation of the sodium channels

485
00:29:23,972 --> 00:29:26,972
and this "h" variable is for the inactivation

486
00:29:27,215 --> 00:29:29,853
of the sodium channels, but in principal

487
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,953
they are absolutely same equations

488
00:29:32,174 --> 00:29:37,561
with alpha "m" and beta "m", and alpha "h" and beta "h"

489
00:29:37,777 --> 00:29:40,276
very similar, each one has it's own

490
00:29:40,456 --> 00:29:43,068
prototypical equation for the description

491
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:46,281
and here they are for the α "m" and for the β "m"

492
00:29:46,464 --> 00:29:51,589
so this is the activation of the sodium channel.

493
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:56,470
and this is for the inactivation .

494
00:29:58,342 --> 00:30:00,467
So again this is an attempt by Hodgkin and Huxley

495
00:30:00,707 --> 00:30:03,707
to fit these continuous lines here

496
00:30:04,503 --> 00:30:05,928
continuous line here

497
00:30:06,141 --> 00:30:11,891
are the fit to the experimental dots using these equations.

498
00:30:14,904 --> 00:30:18,754
Ok, so they use the voltage clamp in order to get these equations

499
00:30:18,987 --> 00:30:21,399
and now they are trying to simulate mathematically

500
00:30:21,607 --> 00:30:26,070
all three equations, actually more than three equations

501
00:30:26,269 --> 00:30:29,132
because you have for alpha and beta, and so forth

502
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:32,752
the set of equations together in order to try to see whether they

503
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:37,761
can replicate mathematically, capture the full action potential.

504
00:30:38,059 --> 00:30:40,258
And here is the result.

505
00:30:40,452 --> 00:30:43,452
This is now the circuit that I mentioned before

506
00:30:44,672 --> 00:30:46,222
of all the channels involved.

507
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:49,381
These are actually the four basic Hodgkin and Huxley equations

508
00:30:49,596 --> 00:30:56,384
this is the current equation depending on the capacitance current

509
00:30:56,587 --> 00:30:58,849
the sodium current, the potassium current and the Leak current,

510
00:31:00,781 --> 00:31:06,856
and these are three more equations for the activation of the "m"

511
00:31:07,066 --> 00:31:10,628
of the sodium activation, the activation of the potassium "n"

512
00:31:10,822 --> 00:31:13,822
and the inactivation of the sodium "h".

513
00:31:14,462 --> 00:31:17,837
So these are the four basic Hodgkin and Huxley equations

514
00:31:18,033 --> 00:31:19,858
and now you know we also have

515
00:31:20,166 --> 00:31:21,741
equations for the alphas and the betas

516
00:31:21,976 --> 00:31:23,826
for each one of them separately

517
00:31:24,086 --> 00:31:25,774
using all of these four equations

518
00:31:25,973 --> 00:31:28,247
plus the equations for alpha and beta

519
00:31:28,493 --> 00:31:32,831
in a rather old primitive computer, compared to what we have today,

520
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:37,549
they succeeded to get the full action potential.

521
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:41,329
Here's the first time you see a simulated

522
00:31:41,706 --> 00:31:42,968
action potential.

523
00:31:43,185 --> 00:31:47,260
So this is the voltage, the solution for this equation

524
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:48,930
that I showed you before

525
00:31:49,106 --> 00:31:51,243
is the solution for the voltage.

526
00:31:51,706 --> 00:31:55,068
So here is the voltage solved by the Hodgkin and Huxley equation

527
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:58,070
and you see that the voltage behaves very similarly

528
00:31:58,292 --> 00:31:59,729
to an action potential.

529
00:31:59,947 --> 00:32:04,784
It grows and then it goes down

530
00:32:05,013 --> 00:32:09,463
even bellow the resting potential, and then it terminates.

531
00:32:11,034 --> 00:32:13,810
But of course they could also see the underlying mechanism

532
00:32:14,048 --> 00:32:15,423
because they had a model, for example

533
00:32:15,652 --> 00:32:18,652
you can see that the conductance of the sodium

534
00:32:18,879 --> 00:32:21,879
is the early conductance is the one that initiates

535
00:32:22,225 --> 00:32:23,387
the action potential.

536
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,427
Why?

537
00:32:24,627 --> 00:32:29,002
Because very early on when the action potential starts growing

538
00:32:29,196 --> 00:32:32,196
if you depolarize the membrane enough

539
00:32:32,341 --> 00:32:36,703
this depolarization very early on opens sodium channels

540
00:32:36,883 --> 00:32:39,883
sodium starts flowing into the cell

541
00:32:40,086 --> 00:32:42,424
and then charges the inside of the cell with

542
00:32:42,633 --> 00:32:47,383
positive charge, so the inside of the cell becomes more positive

543
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:50,173
and then more sodium channels are open

544
00:32:50,397 --> 00:32:53,972
more sodium channels are now carrying sodium charge

545
00:32:54,203 --> 00:32:55,015
into the cell

546
00:32:55,229 --> 00:32:58,504
and the cell becomes more and more positive inside

547
00:32:58,719 --> 00:33:01,719
and this is the blowing of the spike.

548
00:33:03,088 --> 00:33:07,726
But later on, the potassium channels start to open and

549
00:33:07,973 --> 00:33:10,973
potassium channels are later, but they start to open

550
00:33:11,355 --> 00:33:15,992
this now means that the potassium escapes from inside to the outside

551
00:33:16,232 --> 00:33:19,932
due to this gradience potassium leaves the inside of the cell

552
00:33:20,161 --> 00:33:23,436
the potassium ion channels, and this makes the inside

553
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:28,252
more negative, more negative meaning that you end the action potential

554
00:33:28,455 --> 00:33:30,905
and here even more negative because here there is a lot of

555
00:33:31,155 --> 00:33:36,030
conductance for potassium here and the sodium almost ended

556
00:33:36,244 --> 00:33:40,757
so now the potassium carries membrane potential bellow rest

557
00:33:40,954 --> 00:33:43,954
towards the Nernst battery of the potassium

558
00:33:44,167 --> 00:33:47,167
and then potassium closes a little bit slowly

559
00:33:47,381 --> 00:33:50,269
and then ends the complete phenomenon.

560
00:33:50,513 --> 00:33:53,613
So you'll now realize that the action potential

561
00:33:53,806 --> 00:33:57,693
which actually looks very similar to the biological action potential

562
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:03,530
by Hodgkin and Huxley equations, is a really good description

563
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:06,428
of the biological phenomenon that we call spike

564
00:34:06,634 --> 00:34:08,496
or action potential.

565
00:34:08,683 --> 00:34:10,620
So, let me summarize this part.

566
00:34:10,838 --> 00:34:11,988
So as I sad, the Hodgkin and Huxley

567
00:34:12,188 --> 00:34:14,850
is really a marvelous success

568
00:34:15,127 --> 00:34:17,689
of taking biological measurements,

569
00:34:17,964 --> 00:34:20,126
many years of biological measurements

570
00:34:20,318 --> 00:34:21,880
of what ions are involved involved

571
00:34:22,122 --> 00:34:24,734
changing the concentration in sodium and potassium,

572
00:34:24,925 --> 00:34:26,625
but eventually coming to an equation,

573
00:34:26,839 --> 00:34:28,301
a set of four equations,

574
00:34:28,498 --> 00:34:32,873
with some extra equation to describe the rate constance, Alpha and Beta,

575
00:34:33,102 --> 00:34:35,815
and then you get a wonderful description

576
00:34:36,058 --> 00:34:39,333
of this phenomenon that is called the spike.

577
00:34:39,512 --> 00:34:42,337
We know that the spike is carried by two ions,

578
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:45,453
two main ions potassium and sodium

579
00:34:45,882 --> 00:34:48,882
and that's the main thing

580
00:34:49,104 --> 00:34:54,004
depend on voltage, so these two ions, the capability of two ions

581
00:34:54,224 --> 00:34:57,224
to flow through the membrane, depends on particular channels

582
00:34:57,426 --> 00:34:59,451
in the membrane.

583
00:34:59,661 --> 00:35:01,811
Hodgkin and Huxley used to call them gates

584
00:35:02,047 --> 00:35:05,047
these are gates that are opening and closing the membrane

585
00:35:05,418 --> 00:35:09,480
and these gates are themselves voltage dependent.

586
00:35:09,665 --> 00:35:11,928
So you have a phenomenon that is a voltage phenomenon

587
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:15,430
the spike, but the voltage of the spike itself

588
00:35:15,651 --> 00:35:18,188
open the channels, first early channels

589
00:35:18,384 --> 00:35:21,046
the sodium channels, which make the spike itself

590
00:35:21,289 --> 00:35:23,901
grow because the spike in the beginning

591
00:35:24,107 --> 00:35:27,332
insert more and more sodium channels into the axon

592
00:35:27,566 --> 00:35:29,391
and more and more of these sodium channels

593
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,825
make the inside more and more positive

594
00:35:32,013 --> 00:35:35,013
until it blows regeneratively, we call it

595
00:35:35,208 --> 00:35:38,608
but then later on the potassium comes in

596
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:42,915
and the voltage opens the potassium channels

597
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,107
in the membrane.

598
00:35:44,286 --> 00:35:47,698
These potassium channels enable potassium to flow

599
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:51,083
from the inside to the outside, leaving negative traces inside

600
00:35:51,633 --> 00:35:54,345
and these negative traces inside make

601
00:35:54,565 --> 00:35:57,565
the spike go off,

602
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,397
shut off, turn off.

603
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:04,299
So this interplay between the fast inward

604
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:09,515
inactivating  sodium, and the late outward

605
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:14,063
activated potassium is really the underlying mechanism

606
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:17,555
of this fantastic phenomenon, the spike.

607
00:36:17,778 --> 00:36:20,991
So the capability of spike to occur in the axon

608
00:36:21,178 --> 00:36:25,016
critically and totally depend on the existence of

609
00:36:25,234 --> 00:36:28,234
specific ion channels in the axons

610
00:36:28,469 --> 00:36:31,469
that are themselves sensitive to voltage.

611
00:36:31,751 --> 00:36:35,076
They are voltage dependent, or what we call "excitable channels"

612
00:36:35,284 --> 00:36:37,771
and this excitability of the channels

613
00:36:37,953 --> 00:36:42,216
enables the spikes to regenerate itself

614
00:36:42,413 --> 00:36:47,376
and blow itself up and then close itself due to the potassium.

615
00:36:48,085 --> 00:36:50,235
So that's what I wanted to say about

616
00:36:50,423 --> 00:36:52,361
the Hodgkin and Huxley equations.

617
00:36:52,586 --> 00:36:56,261
Now, of course, we have fast computers which I hope you will use

618
00:36:56,453 --> 00:36:59,416
your own computer can simulate the Hodgkin and Huxley equation

619
00:36:59,589 --> 00:37:03,264
very fast, Hodgkin and Huxley worked very hard to solve

620
00:37:03,448 --> 00:37:07,748
the equation numerically, but they eventually succeeded

621
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:12,918
and they got something very nice comparable to what they measured

622
00:37:13,115 --> 00:37:13,940
experimentally.

623
00:37:14,133 --> 00:37:18,071
Before ending this part, I want to say two things.

624
00:37:19,197 --> 00:37:23,072
First of all, as I said

625
00:37:23,254 --> 00:37:26,192
when solving the four equations Hodgkin and Huxley succeeded

626
00:37:26,396 --> 00:37:29,146
to replicate the experimental spike

627
00:37:29,323 --> 00:37:31,685
but not only replicate, and that's a very important

628
00:37:31,866 --> 00:37:35,403
point that I want to make here about a good model.

629
00:37:35,605 --> 00:37:39,943
A good model is not only a replica, of what you already put inside.

630
00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:43,374
A good model, which is very useful for biologists, for example

631
00:37:43,605 --> 00:37:46,305
is a model that gives prediction.

632
00:37:46,496 --> 00:37:49,796
And one of the main predictions of Hodgkin and Huxley is that

633
00:37:49,985 --> 00:37:52,923
after the spike, following the spike

634
00:37:53,134 --> 00:37:56,134
there is a period where you cannot get a second spike.

635
00:37:56,376 --> 00:37:58,638
It's called a refractory period.

636
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:03,277
This was not a part of the initial model but it was explained

637
00:38:03,472 --> 00:38:06,209
by the Hodgkin and Huxley model, so it's a prediction

638
00:38:06,399 --> 00:38:09,212
by a Hodgkin and Huxley model, we know experimentally

639
00:38:09,405 --> 00:38:12,655
that when you stimulate the axon and very early on

640
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:16,772
you stimulate again another axon, it won't generate a second spike.

641
00:38:16,984 --> 00:38:20,671
So there is a period, whereby we cannot get a second spike.

642
00:38:20,879 --> 00:38:23,254
It's a very important period, the refractory period

643
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,590
because it sets the frequency of spikes

644
00:38:25,774 --> 00:38:27,836
that the axon can generate.

645
00:38:28,047 --> 00:38:30,347
One spike, and then stop, no spike,

646
00:38:30,526 --> 00:38:31,951
no matter what you do

647
00:38:32,189 --> 00:38:33,426
and then a second spike.

648
00:38:33,653 --> 00:38:36,653
It's called the refractory period, let's say every 10ms

649
00:38:36,873 --> 00:38:38,798
you can get a spike, this means

650
00:38:38,993 --> 00:38:42,318
hundred spikes per second, hundred hertz.

651
00:38:43,149 --> 00:38:46,149
So the Hodgkin and Huxley model prejudiced and explained

652
00:38:46,481 --> 00:38:49,106
the phenomenon of the refractory period.

653
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:54,967
In the same 1952-D paper also predicted the velocity of

654
00:38:55,209 --> 00:38:59,521
the spike, which is not a part of this local model.

655
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:03,077
The velocity of the spike depends on the length of the axon

656
00:39:03,292 --> 00:39:04,617
the width of the axon

657
00:39:04,823 --> 00:39:06,860
they predicted the velocity of the spike

658
00:39:07,077 --> 00:39:10,702
in the squid giant axon, in their mathematical equation

659
00:39:10,886 --> 00:39:12,323
and it was really, indeed

660
00:39:12,511 --> 00:39:14,461
the same velocity measured experimentally.

661
00:39:14,677 --> 00:39:17,902
So this is a very powerful model because it doesn't only replicate

662
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:21,497
the experimental result, but it explained other results

663
00:39:21,688 --> 00:39:24,688
that were not part of the original model.

664
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,247
And finally, I want to say something very important

665
00:39:27,464 --> 00:39:30,852
which I already highlighted or mentioned before

666
00:39:31,096 --> 00:39:34,096
is that the Hodgkin and Huxley model is a universal model

667
00:39:34,395 --> 00:39:37,395
in the sense that, no matter what cell you take

668
00:39:37,786 --> 00:39:40,724
let's say, now I take for you this cell, which is

669
00:39:40,923 --> 00:39:46,610
a pyramidal cell reconstructed from the cortex, actually

670
00:39:46,813 --> 00:39:51,950
human cell, human pyramidal cell, you saw before, and this is the axon

671
00:39:52,155 --> 00:39:56,518
of this human pyramidal cell, or this is a piece of an axon

672
00:39:57,242 --> 00:39:59,417
And you can see that, if you measure

673
00:39:59,622 --> 00:40:02,622
in this particular cell

674
00:40:05,771 --> 00:40:07,821
if you measure in this particular cell

675
00:40:08,026 --> 00:40:10,776
the spiking activity, you get the spikes.

676
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:14,033
These are the experimental spikes, these are the brown spikes.

677
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:17,697
One spike, another spike, another spike.

678
00:40:17,908 --> 00:40:20,908
These are the experimental spikes.

679
00:40:21,141 --> 00:40:23,403
But now if you model the spikes using

680
00:40:23,593 --> 00:40:26,081
the extension of Hodgkin and Huxley and when I say

681
00:40:26,277 --> 00:40:31,127
extension of Hodgkin and Huxley, I mean that the same formalism

682
00:40:31,349 --> 00:40:33,012
exactly the same formalism

683
00:40:33,201 --> 00:40:36,063
but adding additional currents

684
00:40:36,346 --> 00:40:39,346
still carried by sodium, potassium, or calcium

685
00:40:39,956 --> 00:40:42,856
but with different kinetics, so different Alphas

686
00:40:43,038 --> 00:40:46,501
and different Betas for different channels, we know that there are

687
00:40:46,727 --> 00:40:49,452
slow potassium channels, even slower then in

688
00:40:49,634 --> 00:40:51,247
in the Hodgkin and Huxley case

689
00:40:51,465 --> 00:40:53,477
there are ion channels in the membrane

690
00:40:53,674 --> 00:40:57,974
that are sensitive to calcium, so the channels not only depend on

691
00:40:58,161 --> 00:41:00,698
voltage but also on calcium, and so forth,

692
00:41:00,921 --> 00:41:03,921
but it's the same formalism, and when you extend

693
00:41:03,971 --> 00:41:06,971
the Hodgkin and Huxley formalism, you can get the firing patterns

694
00:41:07,247 --> 00:41:09,935
essentially of every cell in the brain.

695
00:41:10,113 --> 00:41:13,625
This is just one example, the green model

696
00:41:13,845 --> 00:41:17,082
succeeds to replicate the firing of this particular cell

697
00:41:17,276 --> 00:41:19,263
which is a cortical cell, nothing to do with

698
00:41:19,475 --> 00:41:22,188
the squid giant axon, but still fires spikes

699
00:41:22,376 --> 00:41:25,638
and spikes and spikes, but the pattern of activity

700
00:41:25,833 --> 00:41:27,521
depends on these extra channels,

701
00:41:27,775 --> 00:41:30,125
not only the generation of the single spike

702
00:41:30,343 --> 00:41:33,393
but when will the next spike arrive, and the next spike arrive

703
00:41:33,615 --> 00:41:36,090
depends on these other channels with the same

704
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,356
Hodgkin and Huxley formalism.

705
00:41:37,555 --> 00:41:40,280
So it's a wonderful model because it not only captures

706
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:44,495
the spike in the squid giant axon, it captured the whole universal

707
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:47,179
phenomenon of a spike in any cell

708
00:41:47,403 --> 00:41:49,415
and that's why we, in many ways

709
00:41:49,625 --> 00:41:52,825
really adore Hodgkin and Huxley, because they gave us the tool

710
00:41:53,051 --> 00:41:58,813
to simulate one of the two most important signals in the brain,

711
00:41:59,001 --> 00:42:02,001
electrical signals : the spike.

712
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:05,940
The next thing we shall do, we'll go to the synaptic potential.
