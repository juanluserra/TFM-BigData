DR. DAVID COX: So we've talked about motor memory.

1
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,830
And we've talked about emotional memory.

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,290
But the kind of memory we're probably most familiar with

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,000
is declarative memory--

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,850
the recall of stored facts and experiences.

5
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:15,300
These kinds of memory are thought to be subserved

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,960
by another subcortical structure, the hippocampus.

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,420
Like the amygdalae, the hippocampi come in a pair.

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,260
Your two hippocampi sit on either side of the thalamus just

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,850
below the amygdalae.

10
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:29,900
In Greek, hippocampus means seahorse.

11
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,130
And the hippocampus does look a bit like a seahorse.

12
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,310
Its tail curled at the very base of the brain.

13
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,140
The hippocampus is reciprocally connected

14
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,590
to both the cortex and subcortical structures.

15
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,250
Activity in the hippocampus is necessary for converting short-term memories

16
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,750
into long-term memories.

17
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,770
Consolidating an experience or fact held in short-term memory

18
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,740
into long-term storable code.

19
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,680
The hippocampus is also directly connected to the visual cortex,

20
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,760
and it plays a significant role in spatial navigation and memory.

21
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,700
Individuals with extensive damage to the hippocampus

22
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,519
have been occasionally reported throughout history.

23
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,020
One particularly famous case is that of Henry Molaison, a man who was

24
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,500
known as H.M. until his death in 2008.

25
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,910
In the 1950s, as a young man with intractable epilepsy, H.M.

26
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:21,600
had his hippocampi bilaterally removed, along with a large swath

27
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,340
of the adjacent brain.

28
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,430
At the time, doctors didn't know the critical function of the hippocampus

29
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,177
and consolidating memory.

30
00:01:28,177 --> 00:01:30,510
They had recently found that removing parts of the brain

31
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,790
could relieve epilepsy.

32
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,710
Taking out a H.M.'s hippocampi did in fact decrease his epileptic seizures.

33
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,250
But it also left him with devastating memory impairments.

34
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:46,050
Specifically, H.M. could not form any new memories for facts or events--

35
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:49,180
a phenomenon known as anterograde amnesia.

36
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:53,220
He could only remember events from before his surgery.

37
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,420
Understandably, H.M. became the subject of many, many experiments

38
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,930
to study his condition.

39
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:02,010
Every day experimenters would come to him

40
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:05,310
and run experiments to try and understand his memory function.

41
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,850
Each day however, he would have to be introduced to his caretakers

42
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:12,120
again and again and again because he couldn't remember the new people.

43
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,710
Meanwhile, H.M.'s basal ganglia were left completely intact.

44
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:20,550
Accordingly, he had no difficulty learning new procedural tasks.

45
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:25,200
Every time researchers gave him a new task, for instance a tracing task,

46
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,030
they would have to re-explain it.

47
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,630
He insisted that he had never performed the task before, yet each time he did

48
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:33,060
the task, he'd get a little bit better.

49
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,530
As such, H.M. was able to form the procedural subconscious memory required

50
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,970
to learn a new task, but not the declarative conscious memory

51
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:46,110
needed to remember the experience of having performed the task.

52
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,250
What happened to H.M. was terrible.

53
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,600
But as some small silver lining, our understanding of the hippocampus

54
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,010
has been completely transformed by the research his condition enabled.

55
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,620
In addition to declarative memory, the hippocampus

56
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,280
also appears to play an important role in spatial navigation.

57
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,360
In 2014, the Nobel Prize in physiology and medicine

58
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,550
was awarded to three researchers who discovered

59
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:12,630
that cells in the hippocampus, and also in neighboring entorhinal cortex,

60
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:16,230
constitute a sort of positioning system in the brain.

61
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:20,370
These cells appear to create a dynamic map of the environment that

62
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:23,320
shifts as we move from place to place, and encodes

63
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,220
our specific location at all times.

64
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,790
The spatial navigation system is an area of ongoing research.

65
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,920
We still don't understand much about how it functions.

66
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,240
However, studies in rats have shown that between the entorhinal cortex

67
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,590
and the hippocampus, the brain forms a sort of topographic map.

68
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,630
Neurons, in the region of the map corresponding

69
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:45,570
to a particular place in the environment, fire as rats

70
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,220
move through that particular place.

71
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,470
This spatial navigation role and memory role in the hippocampus

72
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:56,320
may not be so different or dissociated from one another.

73
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,795
For instance, particularly if you're a rat,

74
00:03:58,795 --> 00:04:01,170
most declarative memories-- things you need to remember--

75
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:03,390
are associated with particular places.

76
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:06,180
So there's a sense in which the hippocampus, perhaps, represents

77
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,910
context more than anything else.

78
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:12,460
How the hippocampus uses this context to consolidate memories though,

79
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,410
is still largely unknown.

80
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:18,300
However, it seems to involve LTP, or long term potentiation,

81
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,600
which we encountered in earlier modules of this course.

82
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,020
Specifically, LTP may allow the hippocampus to preferentially

83
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,530
strengthen certain patterns of neuronal firing,

84
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:30,990
and these patterns may encode those memories.

85
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:34,230
Interestingly, the hippocampus' plasticity, or its ability

86
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,720
to change its strength of his neuronal connections,

87
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,480
may also extend beyond LTP.

88
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,640
The hippocampus is one of only two regions

89
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,510
where neurogenesis, the birth and migration of new neurons,

90
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:48,360
has been found to occur in the adult brain.

91
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,080
We don't know much about how neurogenesis affects memory.

92
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,930
One hypothesis is that increased neurogenesis

93
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:59,490
makes it easier for the brain to write over previous memories.

94
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,630
This is supported by the fact that infants,

95
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:06,130
who show very high neurogenesis, are prodigious forgetters.

96
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:10,440
They don't form declarative memories for the first two years at least.
