00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:10,553
The hippocampus facilitated many
discoveries, due to its particular

2
00:00:10,613 --> 00:00:16,381
structure and properties. First of all,
it has a relatively simple and ordered

3
00:00:16,401 --> 00:00:21,709
structures, with four layers, where
excitatory cells populate only one

4
00:00:21,79 --> 00:00:27,238
layer. The different hippocampal fields
are connected almost unidirectionally,

5
00:00:27,638 --> 00:00:32,826
and fibers travel orthogonally to the
main dendritic axis of the pyramidal

6
00:00:32,886 --> 00:00:39,527
cells. Furthermore, the synapses are
highly plastic, so that they can change

7
00:00:39,567 --> 00:00:44,132
their strength in response to the pre- and
post-synaptic cells' behavior.

8
00:00:45,413 --> 00:00:52,221
Finally, neurons can be grown in culture,
and acute occulturate slices survive in

9
00:00:52,281 --> 00:00:58,167
vitro for a long time. Here, I would like to
present you a selection of key

10
00:00:58,187 --> 00:01:02,772
discoveries made in the hippocampus,
which can be generalized to other brain

11
00:01:02,832 --> 00:01:10,072
regions. In 1959, George Gray described
two types of synapses in cortex with

12
00:01:10,152 --> 00:01:15,459
electron microscopy. Type I synapses
were more heavily stained, and the

13
00:01:15,499 --> 00:01:19,484
synaptic specializations were
asymmetrical, in that the presynaptic

14
00:01:19,524 --> 00:01:24,95
density was less intensely stained than
the postsynaptic density. Type I

15
00:01:25,01 --> 00:01:31,502
synapses were usually associated with
androidic spines. Type II synapses had

16
00:01:31,662 --> 00:01:36,728
pre- and post-synaptic density with the
same moderate staining intensity, and

17
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:42,074
they were found mainly in association
with dendritic shaft and neural somata.

18
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:49,403
The two types of synapses also exist in the
hippocampus, and the hippocampus was

19
00:01:49,603 --> 00:01:56,126
used to identify the nature of those
synapse types. Using a combination of

20
00:01:56,226 --> 00:02:01,095
intracellular and intracellular
recordings and staining technique, it

21
00:02:01,135 --> 00:02:07,606
became clear that gray type 2 synapses are
inhibitory synapses mediated by GABA-A

22
00:02:07,686 --> 00:02:14,96
receptors. Similarly, it was found that
type 1 synapses are excitatory synapses

23
00:02:15,08 --> 00:02:20,271
mediated by AMPA receptors.
Furthermore, all the main hippocampus

24
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:25,327
pathways, the 3-synaptic loop I
mentioned in the previous lecture, were

25
00:02:25,448 --> 00:02:31,841
found to be of type 1. The term synaptic
plasticity was introduced by Konofsky to

26
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:37,133
describe the changes in synaptic
efficacy that is assumed to be the basis of

27
00:02:37,233 --> 00:02:44,75
information storage in the brain. In
1949, Hebb proposed a hypothesis on how

28
00:02:44,81 --> 00:02:50,651
this synaptic change can take place.
According to Ebb's famous postulate,

29
00:02:51,052 --> 00:02:56,44
when an axon of cell A is near enough to
excite a cell B and repeatedly and

30
00:02:56,5 --> 00:03:02,21
persistently takes part in fighting it,
some growth process and metabolic change

31
00:03:02,25 --> 00:03:10,383
takes place in one or both cells, such that
A's efficacy as one of the cells fighting B

32
00:03:10,763 --> 00:03:16,966
is increased. Neuroscientists then
began to look for experimental evidence

33
00:03:17,106 --> 00:03:23,545
to support Ebb's hypothesis.
Post-tetanic potentiation, or PTP, was a

34
00:03:23,605 --> 00:03:30,016
candidate for a number of years. PTP
appeared as an enhanced synaptic

35
00:03:30,096 --> 00:03:34,562
responses following a period of high
frequency stimulation of afferent

36
00:03:34,642 --> 00:03:41,231
fibers. The main weakness of PTP is an
adequate mechanism for behavioral

37
00:03:41,311 --> 00:03:48,18
learning, but it's limited duration. In
1996, LOMO reported that higher

38
00:03:48,22 --> 00:03:53,287
stimulation frequencies and repeated
tetany can trigger longer lasting

39
00:03:53,367 --> 00:04:00,906
enhancement. This observation allowed
Brice Lomo in 1970 to describe long-term

40
00:04:00,926 --> 00:04:07,974
potentiation, or LTP, which can last for
hours and more. If activity-dependent

41
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:12,619
plasticity operated only to a
non-synaptic weights, saturation of

42
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:17,284
synaptic efficacy would eventually
occur, and a network with maximal

43
00:04:17,304 --> 00:04:22,518
synaptic weights is incapable of
learning. Although potentiated

44
00:04:22,558 --> 00:04:27,885
synapses may eventually decay to
baseline with time, an activity-driven

45
00:04:27,985 --> 00:04:33,572
mechanism to allow the potentiation of
LFTP would enhance the computational

46
00:04:33,632 --> 00:04:40,361
capability of the network. In addition,
long-term depression, or LTD, from

47
00:04:40,441 --> 00:04:45,427
baseline values of synaptic efficacy
would further enhance the flexibility of

48
00:04:45,487 --> 00:04:52,658
the system and increase its storage
capacity. Finally, having mechanism for

49
00:04:52,738 --> 00:04:58,126
both potentiation and depression of
synaptic efficacy can tune the balance of

50
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:04,154
excitation and inhibition, which in turn
determines the overall stability of the

51
00:05:04,234 --> 00:05:13,948
network. Danwiddi and Lynch report in
1978 the first evidence that LTD could be

52
00:05:14,048 --> 00:05:19,161
achieved with low frequency
stimulation. However, several years

53
00:05:19,201 --> 00:05:25,109
later, Judek and Beer found that
prolonged strain of low frequency

54
00:05:25,149 --> 00:05:33,08
stimulation can produce a reliable LTD.
Judek and Beer went on to develop the

55
00:05:33,14 --> 00:05:38,735
notion of graded bidirectional synaptic
modifiability. In this model, with

56
00:05:38,775 --> 00:05:43,56
appropriate high or low frequency
simulation, a synapse could be

57
00:05:43,621 --> 00:05:49,307
potentiated or depotentiated, thus
allow its efficacy to be set anywhere

58
00:05:49,748 --> 00:05:57,437
within a range of approximately 50% of its
base value. Adult neurogenesis, the

59
00:05:57,477 --> 00:06:01,923
maturation of new neurons in the adult
brain, can be considered a form of

60
00:06:01,943 --> 00:06:07,9
structural plasticity. In the 60s,
Altman et al. first reported annulled

61
00:06:08,0 --> 00:06:13,147
neurogenesis in dentate gyrus and
olfactory bulb, the only two regions

62
00:06:13,547 --> 00:06:20,096
where adult neurogenesis is widely
recognized. In the dentate gyrus, new

63
00:06:20,156 --> 00:06:26,484
cells originate from progenitor cells
located in the subgranular zone, a region

64
00:06:26,585 --> 00:06:32,924
between the granule cell layers and the
ilus. Cells in this region divide,

65
00:06:33,124 --> 00:06:37,851
presumably asymmetrically, to produce
some daughter cells that retain the

66
00:06:37,871 --> 00:06:45,943
ability to divide and other cells that
became either neurons or glia. The new

67
00:06:46,124 --> 00:06:51,272
cells migrate a short distance to the
granule cell layers and differentiate

68
00:06:51,332 --> 00:06:58,022
into neurons. The extent of the process is
quite impressive. And for example, in a

69
00:06:58,123 --> 00:07:05,895
young adult rat, several thousands of new
neurons are formed every day. Anyway,

70
00:07:05,915 --> 00:07:12,206
substantial death of granule cells
results in a near static total population

71
00:07:12,246 --> 00:07:19,549
of neurons. The role of neurogenesis in
the adult brain is still not completely

72
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:25,208
understood. It's the subject of an
intense experimental and theoretical

73
00:07:25,308 --> 00:07:34,059
work. Few years after Berger described
the human EEG in 1924, Jung and Kohlmuller

74
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:39,486
found a prominent oscillatory activity
in the rabbit hippocampus, a frequency

75
00:07:39,566 --> 00:07:45,454
between four and seven hertz, called
theta range. From these observations,

76
00:07:45,614 --> 00:07:50,4
researchers started to correlate theta
activity with behavior. In the image

77
00:07:50,42 --> 00:07:56,328
here, you can appreciate the extent of
this research. Today, we know that not

78
00:07:56,468 --> 00:08:01,832
only TID activity is important for the
hippocampus function, but other types of

79
00:08:01,932 --> 00:08:07,257
oscillation has been described and
associated with behavior. The

80
00:08:07,277 --> 00:08:12,002
hippocampus has served as a test bench for
the development of a variety of new

81
00:08:12,022 --> 00:08:17,328
methodology, such as novel recording
techniques. For example, in the

82
00:08:17,348 --> 00:08:21,392
hippocampus, we have the first use of
microelectrodes for extracellular

83
00:08:21,412 --> 00:08:26,533
recording of a single neuron discharge.
The extracellular recordings were used

84
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:31,324
fruitfully in the hippocampus to
characterize the two types of synapses as

85
00:08:31,384 --> 00:08:37,196
we saw previously. Also intracellular
recordings were successful in the

86
00:08:37,236 --> 00:08:41,566
hippocampus, and the first
comprehensive intracellular study used

87
00:08:41,606 --> 00:08:46,631
the hippocampal pyramidal cells.
Finally, I would like to mention the

88
00:08:46,691 --> 00:08:51,8
development of recording techniques
with two or four electrodes, called

89
00:08:51,92 --> 00:08:58,711
respectively stereotrophs and
tetrophs. Those allow the study of neuron

90
00:08:58,731 --> 00:09:04,04
ensemble and therefore phenomena that
occur more at the level of networks than

91
00:09:04,081 --> 00:09:04,962
single cell.
