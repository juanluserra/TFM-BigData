00:00:05,38 --> 00:00:11,4
The role of hippocampus plays a key role in
several brain functions. Here I select

2
00:00:11,5 --> 00:00:20,408
three of the most prominent ones. Memory,
perception of space and time. Between the

3
00:00:20,468 --> 00:00:26,454
late 19th century and early 20th century,
scientists started to localize memory in

4
00:00:26,494 --> 00:00:31,74
the brain. The easiest way to do that was to
correlate memory deficits with

5
00:00:31,82 --> 00:00:37,666
physiological pathologies. In
particular, growing evidence showed a

6
00:00:37,727 --> 00:00:42,812
correlation between memory and temporal
lobe, where the hippocampus is located.

7
00:00:43,096 --> 00:00:48,843
The first tuning point happened with the
work of Scoville and Milner, published in

8
00:00:48,863 --> 00:00:55,612
1957, and the famous patient Ernie
Mollison, who for decades was known as the

9
00:00:55,672 --> 00:01:03,322
patient H.M. to protect his privacy. H.M.
was severely epileptic and his seizures

10
00:01:03,722 --> 00:01:09,066
were resistant to anti-epileptic drugs.
In an attempt to alleviate the seizures,

11
00:01:09,306 --> 00:01:15,855
the patient underwent a bilateral medial
temporal lobe resection. The operation

12
00:01:16,236 --> 00:01:22,985
did reduce the seizure, but left the
patient with a profound amnesia. He could

13
00:01:23,045 --> 00:01:28,393
not remember episodes after the
operation, anterograde amnesia, and

14
00:01:28,453 --> 00:01:35,479
just before the surgery, retrograde
amnesia. During the 60s, the case of HM

15
00:01:36,019 --> 00:01:41,585
promoted the quest for animal model of
amnesia, but the first attempts were not

16
00:01:41,665 --> 00:01:49,374
completely successful. Around 1970,
several important developments took

17
00:01:49,474 --> 00:01:55,48
place that improved the situation. First
of all, researchers developed

18
00:01:55,52 --> 00:02:00,762
behavioral tests that were more
selective for the hippocampus. In

19
00:02:00,782 --> 00:02:07,49
parallel, it became clear that there were
several forms of memory and only a subset

20
00:02:07,55 --> 00:02:14,879
of them depends on the hippocampus. In
fact, we can distinguish a declarative

21
00:02:14,979 --> 00:02:19,365
memory, which is a conscious
recollection of concepts and epithets

22
00:02:19,705 --> 00:02:24,951
can be described in words, and a
procedural memory, which includes motor

23
00:02:24,971 --> 00:02:33,129
skills and doesn't require a conscious
control and attention. Declarative

24
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:38,916
memory can be further divided in episodic
memory, which stores specific personal

25
00:02:38,997 --> 00:02:47,147
experiences, and semantic memory, which
stores factual information. We now know

26
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:54,605
that the hippocampus is involved mostly
in episodic memory. Episodic memory is

27
00:02:54,645 --> 00:03:00,972
the memory of episodes which occur in time
and space. So, does the hippocampus

28
00:03:01,193 --> 00:03:09,522
specifically encode space and time? In
1971, O'Keefe and Dostrosky published a

29
00:03:09,582 --> 00:03:15,009
short communication documenting the
first clear evidence on how hippocampal

30
00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:21,507
cells represent space. In this classical
experiment, rats had microelectrodes

31
00:03:21,647 --> 00:03:25,772
implanted in their brains, which
recorded the activity of several

32
00:03:25,792 --> 00:03:30,397
hippocampal neurons while the animal
could move freely in an environment.

33
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:38,747
O'Keefe and Dostrosky observed that
eight electrodes over 76 correlated with

34
00:03:38,787 --> 00:03:44,574
the position and direction of the animal.
They first described what we now call

35
00:03:44,914 --> 00:03:52,291
place cells. This discovery simulated
O'Keefe and Nadel to formulate the first

36
00:03:52,371 --> 00:03:57,897
of many special theories of the
hippocampus, which was described in the

37
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:06,728
influential book, Hippocampus as a
Cognitive Map, in 1978. In the following

38
00:04:06,808 --> 00:04:12,675
years, researchers discovered other
cells that encode the relationship

39
00:04:12,815 --> 00:04:19,305
between the animal and its location in
space. For example, in the 80s, Rank

40
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:25,892
discovered A-direction cells, which
encode where the animal is facing. At the

41
00:04:25,953 --> 00:04:31,158
beginning of the new century, Edward and
May Britt Moser's group discovered grid

42
00:04:31,178 --> 00:04:38,527
cells, which represent space in an
hexagonal coordinate system. Few years

43
00:04:38,567 --> 00:04:44,293
later, Neil Burge's group discovered
boundary cells, which are sensitive to

44
00:04:44,373 --> 00:04:50,749
boundaries. This line of research has
been so important for modern

45
00:04:50,829 --> 00:04:58,321
neuroscience that in 2014, John O'Keefe
and May Britain Edward Moser received a

46
00:04:58,401 --> 00:05:05,131
Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine.
Convincing evidence that the

47
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:10,419
hippocampus encodes time is most recent,
also due to difficulty in designing

48
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:15,677
unambiguous experiments. The
perception of time is a perception of an

49
00:05:15,817 --> 00:05:20,464
order of sequence in time. So, if the
animal experiences a sequence of

50
00:05:20,624 --> 00:05:25,791
stimuli, it perceives that a stimulus
occurred before, after, or at the same

51
00:05:25,872 --> 00:05:31,299
time as another. To test if the animal
perceives the order of a sequence, the

52
00:05:31,46 --> 00:05:39,566
animal is tested for the memory of this
order. Early evidence show how damage to

53
00:05:39,586 --> 00:05:45,959
the hippocampus impairs memory of the
temporal order of events in both human and

54
00:05:46,16 --> 00:05:52,292
animals. Other early studies associated
the activation of the human hippocampus

55
00:05:52,733 --> 00:06:00,02
with encoding a recall of a sequence of
events. At the cellular level, initial

56
00:06:00,06 --> 00:06:05,827
studies showing an association between
cell filings and time could not exclude a

57
00:06:05,867 --> 00:06:12,836
special component. The work of Mann et al.
in 2007 described some of the first

58
00:06:12,896 --> 00:06:18,483
convincing evidence for such an
association. In the experiment and the

59
00:06:18,523 --> 00:06:24,571
encoding phase, rats alternated between
two sides of a testing enclosure as they

60
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:32,262
sampled a unique sequence of five odors.
At a subsequent test phase, rats were

61
00:06:32,322 --> 00:06:39,033
presented with a randomly selected pairs
of non-adjacent sample odors and were

62
00:06:39,073 --> 00:06:45,564
rewarded for choosing the odor that they
had appeared early in that sample phase.

63
00:06:47,266 --> 00:06:53,597
The rat performed almost 80% correct,
showing they could track the order of

64
00:06:53,697 --> 00:07:00,954
stimuli. The alternation of the location
of the odors allowed experimenters to

65
00:07:01,014 --> 00:07:09,39
distinguish special clues from temporal
clues. In 2011, McDonald et al.

66
00:07:09,41 --> 00:07:15,862
characterized cells in CN1 and named them
time cells, stressing an analogy with the

67
00:07:15,922 --> 00:07:23,222
place cells. In fact, as play cells define
sequences in a spatial dimension, time

68
00:07:23,282 --> 00:07:29,308
cells define sequences in a temporal
dimension. As you see, memory, space and

69
00:07:29,388 --> 00:07:35,634
time are probably three phases of the same
phenomenon. In other words, the

70
00:07:35,654 --> 00:07:42,661
hippocampus can bind stimuli to their
spatial temporal context, a form and a

71
00:07:42,681 --> 00:07:49,27
methodic memory trace. The hippocampus
has an important regions also when we talk

72
00:07:49,33 --> 00:07:54,879
about some types of pathologies. For
example, in the Alzheimer's disease, the

73
00:07:54,92 --> 00:07:59,988
hippocampus has received substantial
attentions since initial alteration of

74
00:08:00,048 --> 00:08:05,337
the pathology seems to start here before
spreading eventually to the rest of the

75
00:08:05,377 --> 00:08:12,617
brain. Another important example is
epilepsy. As in the case of patient HM, the

76
00:08:12,677 --> 00:08:17,706
temporal lobe is often the focus of
seizures, since the hippocampus

77
00:08:17,767 --> 00:08:23,537
formation needs considerably less
current to elicit epileptiform activity

78
00:08:23,898 --> 00:08:30,712
compared to other cortical areas.
Finally, the hippocampus, in particular

79
00:08:30,772 --> 00:08:37,594
CA1, is highly vulnerable to ischemic and
hypoxic insults, making this region

80
00:08:37,915 --> 00:08:41,286
critical also in cerebrovascular
diseases.
